# school management system
 School Management System  Hey there! I’m currently working on a School Management System. Right now, it’s got a home page, a login page, and a registration page. I’m using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MDBootstrap, PHP, and MySQL to build it.  This is just the beginning, and I’ve got plans for adding more features and improvements down the road. Thanks for checking it out—stay tuned for more updates!
